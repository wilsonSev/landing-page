# 🌐 LandingPage – Just Me on the Web

A fun, personal landing page created with pure HTML and CSS.  
This project was built as part of the **Foundations** curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS layout.

## 📌 About the Project

LandingPage is a playful **self-presentation site**.  
It doesn't take itself too seriously — and that’s the point.

The goal was to explore:

- 📄 Semantic HTML5
- 🎨 Responsive layout techniques with CSS Flexbox
- 🧠 Personal branding (but with a twist)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- No frameworks. No JavaScript. Just web basics done right.
